    # Failure mode without a sufficient guard:
    #   The tick-watcher poll loop checks GSI phase BEFORE the wall-clock estimate.  When a
    #   poll cycle fires slightly late (~100 ms overshoot), the GSI may already report
    #   "freezetime" (demo reached next_round_start_tick) before the wall-clock check runs.
    #   This causes OBS to stop AFTER the demo has entered the next round's freeze phase,
    #   so the last recorded frame shows the buy-phase overlay.
    #
    # Guard budget:
    #   poll_latency ≈ 100 ms  (two poll cycles of 100 ms each to guarantee wall-clock wins)
    #   t0_offset    ≈  50 ms  (demo resumes ~50 ms before t0 is set)

    #   Total        ≈ 366 ms  → use 500 ms to have comfortable headroom.
