## Key Features

### Demo Library Management

- **Local Library Records** — List and thumbnail view showing match source, scoreboard, tracked players, display names, notes, and other key info.
- **Auto Directory Monitoring** — Supports monitoring demo download directories from 5E, Perfect World, Official Matchmaking, FACEIT, etc., with one-click import.

### Highlight Parsing & Clip Discovery

- **Batch Demo Parsing** — Parse highlights from multiple demos simultaneously; highlights from the same player across different matches are organized by match.
- **Target Player Lock** — Automatically identify all players in a match and locate targets by Steam ID, platform ID, or nickname; compatible with different demo export conventions from 5E, Perfect World, and Official Matchmaking.
- **Fine-grained Highlight Analysis** — Automatically categorizes **Highlights** (multi-kills, one-taps, clutches, knife kills, jump shots, defuses), **Fails** (taser, Deagle, team kills, "human magnet", "human tracing", "shoulder-to-shoulder" moments), **Cross-round Compilations** (favorite victim, nemesis, kill/death montage, continuous round recording), and **Meme Rounds** (211/o/i/z series with AI round commentary). See [Clip Types & Tags](./docs/highlight_tags.md) for tag descriptions.
- **Round Timeline** — Beyond auto-extracted clip cards, browse kill/death timelines by round to add specific shots, deaths, or entire rounds to the recording queue.
- **Continuous Round Recording** — Record from round start to death or round end; select multiple rounds to combine into a longer clip.

### Auto Recording

- **Batch Recording Queue** — Queue multiple matches and clips; the program sequentially launches CS2 replay and drives OBS to produce videos; preview the entire plan before recording, with per-clip timing adjustments in the queue.
- **Pre-recording Spectator Settings** — One-click spectator HUD configuration (death notices only, hide IDs/chat/demo bars), FOV and viewmodel, flash brightness, voice, resolution and aspect ratio, OBS transitions between clips; experimental POV first-person HUD can be enabled per-match.
- **Diverse Output Styles**:
  - Observer view or POV first-person HUD (toggle radar, adjust top player count display)
  - Clean spectator view, custom FOV, hide grenade trajectories
  - **Victim POV** — After highlight or multi-kill compilations, automatically append victim perspective clips
  - **Keyboard Overlay** — Display WASD, crouch/jump keys in OBS, with manual sync adjustment if needed
  - Fade in/out transitions between clips
- **Safe Recording Solution**:
  - Controls recording via OBS and game state coordination, no injection or game hooking
  - Automatically backs up and restores your keybinds and graphics settings after recording


### Compilation Workbench

- Successfully recorded clips are automatically stored in the library; use the Compilation Workbench to drag-and-drop reorder, add BGM/transition themes, and export MP4; filter by highlight/fail/compilation/timeline types, with intro/outro arrangement.
- **Player Info Card** — Enable bottom-left corner watermark when exporting: briefly displays player nickname, clip type (highlight/fail/compilation), round and scenario tags (e.g., multi-kill, one-tap) at the start of each clip; upload custom avatars for each player appearing in the timeline, or display first letter of nickname if no avatar. Perfect for Bilibili-style highlight intros without manual PR editing.
- **FFmpeg Configuration Required**: Download Windows builds from [FFmpeg Official](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/), extract and set the full path to `ffmpeg.exe` in the settings page. Export prioritizes GPU hardware encoding (NVENC/QSV/AMF), falling back to software encoding if unavailable.


### AI Commentary (Optional)

- **OpenAI-Compatible Multi-Provider** — Built-in support for DeepSeek, Tongyi Qwen, Zhipu GLM, MiniMax, OpenAI, OpenRouter; local models via Ollama, LM Studio.
- **Sarcastic Persona Prompt** — Hype for highlights, roast for fails, meme deaths as jokes; hard constraint under 100 characters, single-line JSON output, no off-topic chatter.
- **Round Meme Compilation Review** — 211/o/i/z meme rounds trigger "Round Comprehensive Review", independent from clip-level scoring.

## Installation

Download the latest `CS2-Insight-Agent-Setup-x.x.x.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/DrEAmSs59/CS2-insight-agent/releases), run the installer and follow the prompts.

After installation, launch from desktop or start menu. **No browser needed, no manual backend start** — the Electron main process automatically launches the Python backend service internally.

The app includes **online update** functionality: automatically checks for new versions on startup, with notifications in the top-right corner; click to download and install within the app, no manual re-download needed.

> **Recommended: Installation path without Chinese characters.** e.g., `D:\CS2-Insight-Agent\` ✅, `D:\游戏工具\CS2-Insight-Agent\` ❌

### Safe Usage Tips

- **Default Recording Process** launches CS2 with `-insecure` for local demo playback only; no DLL injection or hooking; does not modify `.dem` files on disk, does not connect to, modify, or interfere with any official game servers, matchmaking services, or anti-cheat systems, nor does it provide any cheating, detection bypass, or fair-play disruption features. **Do not use in parallel with a CS2 client logged into matchmaking servers** to avoid triggering unnecessary anti-cheat warnings.
- If you **actively enable POV** in "Common Parameters → Experimental Features", the program temporarily writes `pov.vpk` to CS2's `game/csgo` directory and **incrementally modifies** `gameinfo.gi`'s `SearchPaths` to load POV HUD resources; automatically restored after recording or abnormal termination. This mode also **forces** `-insecure` when launching CS2. **Do not use to connect to VAC-secured servers**.
- Recording temporarily modifies several CS2 archive cvars and keybinds. This project automatically backs up your original `config.cfg` / `video.txt` / `user_convars_*.vcfg` to the program data directory's `.cs2_config_backup` when starting recording, and restores them afterward; if settings were overwritten due to abnormal exit, manually retrieve original files from that directory.
